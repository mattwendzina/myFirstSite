        <h3> Background </h3> 
        <p> I am a creative person who always loves to be learning new things. I trained formally trained in music and took up a career in music teaching, both as a guitar tutor and as a classroom music teacher. In 2014, I had the chance to move to the United States to take a teaching position at a small private school in Fayetteville, Arkansas. This was an incredible time where I learned so much and made life-long friendships. </p> 
        <p> At the end of 2015 I returned to the UK and made the decision to take a break from teaching. Over the following two years I did a wide variety of jobs, as well as training as a photographer and running a small event/wedding photography business for a year. At the beginning of 2018 I decided I wanted to pursue something new and began to look into web development. Over the past 12 months I have been teaching myself to code and have since been lucky to get a lot of practice at the basics in my last job as a content manager/developer. </p>

                <p> From 2014 to 2015 I had the privilige to teach in an amazing private school in Arkansas, Fayetteville, USA.

                    <h4> Wedding Photography </h4>
                    <p> During 2016 I began training to become a wedding and events photographer. Having done events for over 5 years I decided to do a number of wedding photography courses and had the opportunity to photograph four weddings. While it's not something I've decided to take full time, it's something I still really enjoy doing when I have the opportunity.  </p>
